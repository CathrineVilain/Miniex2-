I didnt really know what to code at first. But then this idea appeared in my mind. I wanted to make the user feel intrigued. I wanted to spike their curiosity. After this I want to surprise them, insult them even. This idea of emotional responses changing suddenly is something I consider to be "fun".  In order to create this shock I need some different elements 

So basically the idea is; You click on a flower once in order to make it bloom. But then you wonder what happens when you click a second time and you do. Then a middle finger appears. This is the sudden shift I was talking about earlier. 

The general idea was to find a photo series of a flower blooming. I found two good quality images of a crocus with a black background. I decided to make my background black as well in order to make things simple. Then I found my last image   Then I saved the images in my project folder in the folder Flowers.  

I want to start with a song to set the mood. I immediately thought of morning mood by Edvard Grieg. I found an mp3 file and downloaded it, then I saved it in my project folder in a new folder called "Sounds". 

When i had all my files i started to code. Because of research i knew that in order to use my files the would have to be shown in the function preload. I placed all of my files there an defined them. After that I created my background and canvas in setup.
