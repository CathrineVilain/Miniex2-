I didnt really know what to code at first. But then this idea appeared in my mind. I wanted to make the user feel intrigued. I wanted to spike their curiosity. After this I wanted to surprise them, insult them even. This idea of emotional responses changing suddenly is something I consider to be "fun".  In order to create this shock I need some different elements 

So basically the idea is; You click on a flower once in order to make it bloom. But then you wonder what happens when you click a second time and you do. Then a middle finger appears. This is the sudden shift I was talking about earlier. 

The general idea was to find a photo series of a flower blooming. I found two good quality images of a crocus with a black background. I decided to make my background black as well in order to make things simple. Then I found my last image   Then I saved the images in my project folder in the folder Flowers.I want to start with a song to set the mood. I immediately thought of morning mood by Edvard Grieg. I found an mp3 file and downloaded it, then I saved it in my project folder in a new folder called "Sounds". 

In making this program I've learned how to load files to a program using different syntaxes. I've also learned how to make the files actually appear in the browser. I learned that if the file is something that you wan't to make permanent, you have to place in in setup. If it's a variable you should place it in draw, because when the file is in draw you can change it. If you wan't different files to appear at different times, then you have to tie everything together. You have to name your variables and make certain rules for these valuables forexample; 
function draw() {
  if (flowerX === 0){
    image(flower1,0,0)
  }
